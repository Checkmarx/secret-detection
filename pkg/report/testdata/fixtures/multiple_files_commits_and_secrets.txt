A pre-receive hook set server side prevented you from push secrets.
To proceed, choose one of the following workflows:

  - Sanitize and Push:
      1. Rewrite your local Git history to remove all exposed secrets.
      2. Store secrets securely using one of these methods:
         - Use environmental variables
         - Use a secret management service
         - Use a configuration management tool
         - Encrypt files containing secrets (the least secure method)
      3. Push code.

  - Ignore detected secrets:
      1. Contact your system administrator to update the server-side secret scanner
          configuration to ignore the detected secret.
      2. Once the new ignore rules are in place, retry pushing your code.

  - Bypass the secret scanner:
      1. Run `git push -o skip-secret-scanner`
      2. If that does not work, ask your system administrator to update the server-side
          configuration to allow skipping the secret scanner.

You can set up pre-commit secret scanning to avoid rewriting git history in the future:
